# 🕉️ Sadhana – Master Instruction & Continuity File

> **Purpose**: This document is the *single long‑lived instruction file* for the Sadhana (Digital Naam Bank) project.  
> It exists to preserve **intent, decisions, boundaries, and truth** across time, contributors, and future iterations.

---

## 1. How This Document Must Be Used

- This file is **authoritative**.
- Any future design, code, monetization, or architectural decision must:
  1. Be checked against this document
  2. Either comply with it, or
  3. Explicitly update this document

❗ Nothing is "assumed". Everything important is **written**.

---

## 2. Core Identity of the Product

**Product Name**: Sadhana – Digital Naam Bank

**Product Nature**:
- A spiritual *practice companion*
- A *witness* to sadhana, not a judge
- A privacy‑first, offline‑first system

**The app is NOT**:
- A game
- A productivity tracker
- A leaderboard
- A competitive system

---

## 3. Fundamental Philosophical Rules (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **Offline‑first is sacred**
   - Sadhana must never be blocked because of internet absence.

2. **Truth over enforcement**
   - The system records reality.
   - It never silently corrects, deletes, or manipulates user effort.

3. **Transparency always**
   - Overlaps, conflicts, parallel sessions are shown — never hidden.

4. **User is the final authority**
   - Especially during merge, sync, and Naam Daan.

5. **Backend is a witness, not an owner**
   - No server‑side jaap calculation.
   - No server‑side decision making on authenticity.

---

## 4. Core Concepts (Canonical Meanings)

### 4.1 Ekagrata
- Active focus time
- Counted **only** when user interaction is present

### 4.2 Naam Jaap
- The act of chanting/writing
- All effort is recorded
- Effort is never erased

### 4.3 Overlap
- When Naam Jaap occurs on more than one device at the same time
- Overlap is **classified**, not condemned

### 4.4 Naam Daan
- A **declared offering**
- Never automatic
- Never silent
- Always reversible until confirmed

---

## 5. Device & Session Principles

### 5.1 Device Identity
- Each device has a permanent `deviceId`
- Generated once
- Never auto‑merged

### 5.2 Session Reality
- Multiple devices may operate simultaneously
- Parallel usage is allowed
- No hard blocking of sadhana

### 5.3 Session Roles
- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `guest`

Roles affect **interpretation**, not **recording**.

---

## 6. Multi‑Device & Sync Rules

1. If a logged‑in user opens another device:
   - Show a warning
   - Allow continuation as secondary or guest

2. All devices record:
   - Count
   - Ekagrata
   - Time range

3. During sync or merge:
   - Detect overlaps
   - Present:
     - Total Jaap (effort)
     - Overlap Jaap
     - Accepted Jaap

4. The system **never auto‑decides** authenticity.

---

## 7. Naam Daan & Transfer Rules (High Sensitivity)

1. Naam Daan is optional and premium
2. It requires explicit user declaration
3. Original performer is **always preserved**
4. “On behalf of” must be intentional and visible
5. Public views (Naam Bank) show **only aggregates**, never rankings

---

## 8. Product Packages (Locked Definition)

### 🟢 Package 1: Sadhak

---

## 9. Architecture Boundary Rules

### Allowed
- Local storage (IndexedDB)
- Client‑side crypto
- Optional minimal backend

- Forced login
- Silent data alteration
- Gamification metrics

---

## 10. Intellectual Property Strategy (Guidance)

- Do **not** rush full patents
- Maintain strong documentation (this file)
- Prefer provisional patent or defensive publication
- Trademark names & identity

Stewardship > Ownership

---

## 11. Change Management Rule

Any future change must:
1. Reference this document
2. State what is being changed
3. Update this file accordingly

If it is not written here — it is not final.

---

## 12. Final Declaration

This project is designed to **outlive trends**, devices, and platforms.

The goal is not speed.
The goal is **truthful continuity of sadhana**.

🕉️ *Let this system remain a witness, not a distraction.*
